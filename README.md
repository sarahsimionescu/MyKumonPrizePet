# MyKumonPrizePet
A cute Java project I created last summer to encourage students at my local Kumon center!
# The Story
Last summer, I was a Math and English instructor at my local Kumon center. I had just completed Grade 12 computer science and Java was the only programming language I had learned. A particular student of mine struggled to find the motivation to complete her work. One day she decided to bring her stuffed animals to cheer her along, and she completed her homework with more enthusiasm than ever. Inspired by her, I developed a program in my free time using Java called "The Grantham Plaza Kumon Prize Pet," where students would adopt a virtual pet, log their completed homework and receive prizes! I spoke to students and instructors about exactly what they looked for in such a program and adapted the applciation to their needs. It was my first introduction to software development. It has been gratifying to hear that the kids enjoy completing their homework and leveling up their pets every week. I hope that with my newly developed skills I can create a new web-app version of this game!

## Description
Each student logs-in, and is greeted with their “Grantham Plaza Kumon Prize Pet”: A dog or cat named by the student! This pet receives points for every completed homework booklet the student returns, and receives additional points when the student has completed an entire week in a row! Each time a prize pet “levels up” the student receives prize tokens which can be exchanged for real prizes from our treasure box!
# Instructions for Use
1. Download and open the project using Netbeans IDE
